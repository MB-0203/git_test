TEST TO-DO LIST

1. Get the git basic concept
2. Try it out to really understand it
3. Repeat until you are 100% comfortable
4. New task for test
5. New Branch called "test" added in Git
  NOTE: To merge the new state (created with line 5) to the main (fka. master) branch, 
  you'd have to first STAGE and COMMIT this branch. 

  After committing your newly created "test" branch, switch back to the "main" branch by running: git checkout main.
